A project dedicated to the storage of information onto DNA.

This repository is dedicated to the creation of a new pieces of software regarding the encoding of binary information
to DNA.  The attatched file is the original project that I created.  It uses a simple algorithim to read pairs of
bits and then encodes them to DNA.  I warn you this is very basic.  If you have any questions please email
